      <p>
        <b>Clicking on an unknown file or attachment:</b> Here, the attacker
        deliberately sends a mysterious file to the victim, as the victim opens
        the file, either malware is injected into his system or it prompts the
        user to enter confidential data. Using an open or free wifi hotspot:
        This is a very simple way to get confidential information from the user
        by luring him by giving him free wifi. The wifi owner can control the
        userâ€™s data without the user knowing it. Responding to social media
        requests: This commonly includes social engineering. Accepting unknown
        friend requests and then, by mistake, leaking secret data are the most
        common mistake made by naive users. Clicking on unauthenticated links or
        ads: Unauthenticated links have been deliberately crafted that lead to a
        phished website that tricks the user into typing confidential data.
